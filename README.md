# Python-challenge

This is my overall third and first Python challenge. In this assignment, I was required complete two Python challenges i.e. ‘PyBank’ and ‘PyPoll’. Therefore, I was provided with two main folders named ‘PyBank’ and ‘PyPoll’. Inside each of these folders, there was another folder called ‘Resources’. There were two CSV (Comma-Separated Value) files in each of these ‘Resources’ folders. The ‘Resource’ folder in ‘PyBank’ had a CSV file called ‘budget_data.csv’ and the ‘Resource’ folder in PyPoll had another CSV file called ‘election_data.csv’. I was required to create a main ‘Python’ script file called ‘main.py’ respectively for both the challenges i.e. ‘PyBank’ and ‘PyPoll’. As part of my assignment requirements, I performed the following tasks:
* Created a ‘Git Hub’ repository with the name ‘Python-challenge’
* Cloned my ‘Python-challenge’ repository to my computer
* Used the correct path to read the CSV files from the ‘Resources’ folders
* Created ‘analysis’ folder within both the folders i.e. ‘PyBank’ and ‘PyPoll’.
* Used ‘main.py’ files to run the analysis and generate ‘analysis.txt’ within the created ‘analysis’ folders for both ‘PyBank’ and ‘PyPoll’
* Comented the final code in 'main.py' for both ‘PyBank’ and ‘PyPoll’
* Performed ‘git add’, ‘git commit’ and git push’ for all the above-mentioned data, files and changes in ‘Python-challenge’ folder.

For ‘PyBank’ part of my ‘Python’ assignment, using dataset from two columns: ‘Date’ and ‘Profit / Losses’, I analyzed and recorded the following using ‘budget_data.csv’:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of ‘Profit / Losses’ over the entire period
* The average of the changes in ‘Profit / Losses’ over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

For ‘PyPoll’ part of my ‘Python’ assignment, using dataset from three columns: ‘Voter ID’, ‘County’ and ‘Candidate’, I analyzed and recorded the following using ‘election_data.csv’:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
